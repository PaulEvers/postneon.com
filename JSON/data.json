William is the archetype of the lazy, energy lacking and feeling tired about life. Somehow, this makes William able to transit the different environments.

They will be able to influence the visual composition and switch between various camera positions within the environment by typing in different key commands. The visual narrative is accompanied by a unique sonic experience formed by various international artists curated by Pim Boreel. \n\nPost Neon envisions a post-pandemic era where people develop a shared mindset and communal spirit that can be experienced during nightlife. Post Neon, is a new Amsterdam based creative studio that is known for surrealistic, autonomic work with a focus on scale, material and texture in 3D content creation and creative technologies.\n",
